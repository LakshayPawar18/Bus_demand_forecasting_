# Bus Journey Demand Forecasting - Hackathon Project

This project predicts the number of seats that will be booked for a bus journey, 15 days before the actual journey date. The goal is to forecast demand at a route level using only historical data up to that point.

## What this project does

- Uses historical booking and search data to train a machine learning model.
- Makes predictions 15 days before the journey date.
- Outputs the predicted total seat bookings in the required submission format.
